Most of the pictures you'll find here were shot on my Nikon D750 with a Nikkor 35mm f2D lens.

I apologize for the inconsistencies in my photos and editing as I'm still finding my photography style. Currently, I enjoy shooting in standard color for street photography and black and white for portraits. 

If you would like to hire me for a photoshoot my rates are generally around $80/hr and $8 per photo print, but it depends on the situation. I'm not pressed about counting each minute and I'll probably lump the shooting and post production for the the hour(s) together to give a ballpark estimate of what I think the photos are worth.
