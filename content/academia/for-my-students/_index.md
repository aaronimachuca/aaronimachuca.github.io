This page is dedicated to my present (and potentially future) students who are taking the 'Introduction to Continuum Mechanics' course at Berkeley, also known as ME 185/287. 

It's not uncommon for new learners of the field to struggle with the fundamental concepts behind continuum theory, especially without the proper mathematical background. My aim is to help you build that foundation so you can properly contend with concepts that may otherwise feel overwhelming in its obscurity. 

Throughout the semester, I'll take note of what people seem to struggle with and write explicit notes on related concepts to (hopefully) help elucidate confusing topics. Of course I'm not a mind reader, so the more questions you ask, the more you can help me help you!
