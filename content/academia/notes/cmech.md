These notes are meant to serve as my own personal documentation for useful references I often rely on from Professor Casey, Steigmann, Papadopoulos, and Govindjee's texts on continuum theory. They are a tentative work in progress as there's a lot to cover, but hopefully they'll be useful to you to if you're one of my students or another enthusiast of the field.
