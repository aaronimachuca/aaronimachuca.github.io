These notes are meant to serve as my own personal documentation for useful references I often rely on from Professor Casey, Steigmann, Papadopoulos, and Govindjee's texts on continuum theory. They are by no means my original work, and the only real adjustments I will be making are addendums to clarify or elaborate on details that are otherwise subtle to me. This is a heavy work in progress as there's a lot to cover, but hopefully they'll be useful to you too if you're one of my students or another enthusiast of the field.
