Having been born and raised in the slums of eastern Los Angeles, I used to hold a strong disdain for urban society and the lifestyle imposed upon its residents (myself included). This sentiment is of course no secret those who have held a conversation with me for more than a day, but is something I regularly felt compelled to mention because I failed to understand the appeal of big cities. Within the past year, though, my attitudes on this matter have somewhat pivoted with skating and photography being introduced into my life.

Particpating in hobbies that force me to go outside and interact with the architectures in my proxmity, both literally and figuratively, has allowed a new perspective to sprout within my jaded worldviews. The city, initially nothing more to me than a brutualist tumor wilting precious wildlife, may have some more merit to it than I gave it credit for. Yeah there's trash everywhere and the geopolitics pervading into our daily lives is nothing short of maddening, but I can't rip a sick nosegrind on dirt and grass. There's a certain sense of stereotypical recklessness that appeals to my punk spirit whenever I go out in tattered clothes--board in hand, headphones blasting chaotic hardcore, and not a care in the world. I know from the outside looking in it very much just seems like I'm describing my quarter-life crisis unfurling in real time, but I'm having fun and as my mom so elegantly put it, "he's just living the teenage years he never had!" Frankly, I think the sharp dichotomy between scribbling runic equations in my aspiring professorship and bombing hills in my adrenaline-fueled lifestyle is very amusing.

Adolescent ramblings aside, skating is intriguing to me in how the competition factor is inherently absent in the sport. The thrasher brand that has subconsciously been imprinted in our head when we think about skating culture is comically contradictory to how encouraging the community is at large in supporting their fellow peers. It is a almost purely a battle of self-improvement to overcome the challenges that present itself in street, transition, freestyle, or any other archetypes that emcompass the sport. That's not to say everyone in the community is a saint in baker tees, this is still a sport conceived in California after all. It is inevitable to run into the skate-rat caricature who will sneer at you for mall-grabbing or not being able to kickflip, but I'm a 24-year-old engineer with money in my bank account (I have $20) what do I care what they say. Regardless, it's incredible to me how skating has created context in an enviornment I thought to be an insipid wasteland. Nothing has fundamentally has changed, I just had what was given, presented in a way I've never seen it before. Stairs are perfect to ollie on and off of, ramps are smooth enough to boardslide on, curbs provide just enough friction for grinding slappys, and anything with more than a 5Â° incline is getting bombed and that's just how it is! Urban development was not meant nor designed for skating, but skaters managed to find a way to perfectly wedge themseleves in on governmental property anyway. The cracked roads I have explored by virtue of letting my board guide me in no particular direction

Where I have once yearned to withdraw as a recluse in the woods (with no relation to any Berkeley math professor...), I can now at least appreciate the cultural colors that paint my neighborhoods in northern and southern California. That's not to say I have completely forgiven the faults readily found (in these enviornments) and continue to have (blacken? decolors?) my experiences to this day, it isn't as dreadfully regret as I felt in my youth and young adulthood.
