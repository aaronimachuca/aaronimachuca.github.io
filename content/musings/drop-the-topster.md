Who could've possibly seen this one coming. With apologies to all my friends who had to endure my constantly updated music charts for years on end. But for real this time, here are my current top 40 albums.

Music has always played an interesting role in my life as it's always been the one artistic medium I have never really had the desire to engage with beyond dabbling, but ACTUALLY dabbling, in some instruments here and there. I've always thought that if I were to really learn an instrument, I would want it to either be the bass-guitar or cello, but given how much energy my current hobbies expend out of me--it seems unlikely that this will happen anytime soon. Though, I wouldn't mind picking up some vocal lessons to properly learn how to sing or belt out a gnarly scream.

Anyway I digress, it would feel unnecessary to clarify how impactful music has been on me or provide some introspection as to what role it has served for me in the grand scheme of things. Most people like music, some people really like music; I so happen to really love certain music that span a wide variety of genres, let's just leave it at that as far as the psychoanalysts are concerned. It wasn't until my early undergrad years that I really tried to broaden my music horizons, and since then I've learned that I am typically partial towards: folk, electronica, hardcore punk, noise, and sometimes ambitious fusions of these genres. My music palette isn't limited to the aforementioned genres as my topster above would suggest, but it's probably the most effective way to appeal to my tastes if someone were to send me recommendations. Although I really wouldn't suggest doing so because I would feel really bad if you sent something that I thought it was some hot garbage or even worse, had no reaction towards. The unfortunate reality is I've listened to a fair amount of music and my criteria for "quality" only becomes stricter and better defined the more music I listen to. In any case, I thought it might be fun to give a blurb about what I think about each respective album I have on my chart. I'll probably start with the first five since they're the most significant albums and gradually work my way down over time. 

On a related note, if you wanna read my spiel discussing Metallica's discography check that out, [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rjGLcd7bPCEs3qYR5i8t5KDwCUvCBmdwYiYghNCjSvc/edit). 

**1. The Hotelier - Home, Like NoPlace Is There**
{{< centered-images "https://i.imgur.com/MmvLcXq.png" "60%">}}

_"I had a chance to construct something beautiful and I choked"_

I was introduced to this album as per my friend Ruijie's recommendation during my sophomore year in undergrad, and I haven't been the same since. I find it incredibly difficult to talk to anyone about this album because I feel anything I could possibly say would simultaneously be an over and understatement as to what the record actually is. It's never easy to discuss grief or the things that cause us to grieve, much less to be able to handle it with any semblance of tact. It's a topic well connected to the midwest emo genre, but it's usually addressed through junevile subject matters involving teenage heartbreak and other digestible forms of anguish. We are not often digging through the roots to pull on our traumas from the source, and that's exactly the premise that Christian Holden tackles within the lyricism of Home. From front to back, Home systematically confronts sensitive issues found within the silent outskirts of our minds and presents them in their emotionally raw and unadulterated form. All the meanwhile, the accompanying instrumentation takes its time to breathe, to wane in and out, and punctuate in a long-winded, bombastic break whenever the narrative sees fit. The album isn't exactly pushing the envelope as far as the post-hardcore soundscape goes, but what it does have works and to harp on that aspect is missing the point of what the record is trying to do. I don't think that's a cop-out excuse either because I'm not excusing anything, I just think the band is providing more of heartfelt experience as opposed to trying to stand equally in height to their emo predecessors. And for that reason, this album stands out in a way that has personally struck me more than anything I have ever listened to before. 

5+/5

**2. Daughters - You Won't Get What You Want**
{{< centered-images "https://i.imgur.com/dgIcuzQ.jpg" "60%">}}

_"If there is an ocean beyond the waves"_

Before I delve into this album, I feel I should probably address the elephant in the room and the responses I get from folk who side-eye me for still listening to this record. I think it should be obvious that I openly condemn the actions of Alexis Marshall against Kristin Hayter in his onslaught of heinous trangressions against her on all moral fronts. My enjoyment of an album has nothing to do with being an apologist for or excusing the actions of depraved individuals. With that being said, I don't believe that Alexis Marshall represents the Daughters label or band as a whole within the span of their creative works over the past two decades. I honestly don't have the patience to tailor a discussion on the matter beyond that and we can agree to disagree otherwise. 

Of all the possible ways I could've been piplined into becoming a noise rock fan, this was definitely not the most accessible choice to go with. Around the time I first gave this album a spin I think I was still bumping generic metalcore and whatever other landfill I had buried in my music library from my high school days. To say I was not well aquainted with the dissonant and lo-fi production found in similar industrial or noise music would be putting it lightly. Nevertheless, I was properly marinated to listen to the album as I had been studying for finals in the hallways of my dorm at some ungodly hour into the night when I remembered Anthony Fantano's review on the album I watched earlier that day (I was 18 leave me alone). I don't remember how or why that album came to mind when it did but I do distinctly recall the pain resonance I felt in my sleep deprived trance while listening. You have to be in a certain state of mind to willingly subject yourself to this record and you have to have a certain personality to find enjoyment in the listen. It's such an uncomfortable, abrasive experience that tests your ability to withstand a turbulent and blistering composition that has you question how a guitar can even make such harrowing sounds--like the band animated their instruments and all they're able to do is cry out cacophonous screams that are scraping against your ears. A huge aspect as to what makes this album so uneasy is the cracked mirror it holds up to the audience revealing a monstrous element innate to our psychology that we have trouble admitting to. There's a kernel of truth in the narration describing the unhinged horrors to our character that to some degree, is universal in the human condition. The production, synthesizing these staggering percussions alongside crashing guitar riffs and synths taken straight out of a horror movie, are all carried out with such masterful pacing in its delivery that it makes me reach some kind of demonic nirvana. There's nothing quite like this gothic masterpiece, that in an ironic fashion, has helped me find solace in my own personal circumstances.

**3. Mid-Air Thief - Crumbling**
{{< centered-images "https://i.imgur.com/sQ0T35h.jpg" "60%">}}

_"물에 발 담가 모두 함께 정화를 시켜"_

Transitioning onto a lighter note, Crumbling is another album that Ruijie recommended me and this was a special album because it opened a gateway to another world of music whose existence I was unaware of up until that point. 

I also recently got this one on vinyl and I don't even own a turntable B)
