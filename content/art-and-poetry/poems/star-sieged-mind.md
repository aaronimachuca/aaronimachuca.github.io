  Star-Sieged Mind
</span>

The voids in my head \
wish to fill the silence, \
so they speak your name.

A whisper whizzing by \
as a shooting star, I wish \
upon their jeweled wonders, \
cosmic seas of speckled fable \
the Great Bear and her cubs, \
the legend of Orion, \
a muse for my writings, \
to dot my own constellation \
scribbled idea, outlines a \
vague contour of your image. 

I have met many a platitude \
on the dream shorelines \
voyaging contradiction and clarity, \
I seek no wisdom but absorb \
them as I have seen traces of \
millennium glory, previous \
experiments before us — \
scrapped to galatic dust, \
streams of fluidic chaos, \
a single strip could span a \
century to decipher in full, \
or one of the Lord’s lemmas: \
$\mathbf{\daleth} = \aleph;\_p \Lambda^*. $

Sailing back to world reality, \
the infinite unknown grounds \
itself in sunshine delight and \
familiar morning sensories \
beautiful birds, singing chirps \
the branching greenery take \
my arms, a beautiful world. \
The joyous blue above and \
surrounding ocean reenact \
constellar visions, cloud mists \
swirl as another millennium \
mystery, still I love it so, \
the boundless sea could swallow \
me whole but instead chooses \
to blanket me in serendipity, \
I hear the sound of your voice \
no longer as whisper of memory, \
rather how it appears in full \
off a lovely smile speaking \
in loving words I have missed.

The mystery no longer keeps \
me in thralls but enthralls \
for the distant promise, \
the fable in my starry mind \
or the story personified, \
a beautiful person.
