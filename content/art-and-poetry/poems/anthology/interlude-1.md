  I. Deathless (Of Sappho)
</span>

Lady Aphrodite, blessed \
consult to my great loves, \
what does the meat of my \
half-heart taste like? As \
the sharp of incisors \
slam down another \
apple bite, and my life \
leaks down your chin. 

O Aphrodite, \
I know the strength \
that oils bruiseless skin. 

This naked might whips \
the day, while she lies \
lordly â€” a child of Zeus. \
She loosens white lilies, \
blacks the earth, fashions \
them for her royal curls. \
Her mouth mutter-mutters \
doom omens, and the wild \
unfur their knives.

The sun sunk beneath her \
cloud likeness, storm bolts \
give prelude to her love \
conquest, unrelenting. 

Deathless Aphrodite, \
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\] you \
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\] have done \
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\] \
&emsp;&emsp;\] me, in \
\] \
was it too much to ask, \
was I wrong to plea, \
to let my heart be still, \
be selfish \
to love what it loves?
