If you happened to know me prior to 2021, you might have heard me discuss a set of very sentimental poems I've had in the works since my junior year in high school. I had always envisioned these poems being a part of some grandiose project when I would finally come out to publish them. As a result, they have gone through an obscene number of iterations and redrafts over the years due to the unreasonable expectations I had set for them. 

I have since decided to allow these poems to exist as a relic of my juvenile self and publicly display these works in all their amateur faults. Over time I plan to finish the drafts I've held onto for years and post them here to finally close the lid on this project.
