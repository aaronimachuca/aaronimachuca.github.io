  Psalm for the Self
</span>

My life wears a sarong sash of \
Van Gogh greens & mythic tapestries, \
of the Earth’s water-blood & soil-skin, \
dawned of the frost father, Ymir, \
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;in his dismembered image. 

With years passed, \
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;on Death's watch, \
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I'm trembling — \
to jot the tempest winds of a moment, \
when my marionette muscles strain in age. \
But I would write still, on broken fingers, \
even if a humble life \
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;would grant tenancy in Elysium, \
and crown a hero-halo over my brow. \
I would torch my ghost in ghastly flames, \
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;stirred in my scorn to live now, \
even if in this life, the Lord's trumpeters \
do not gleam me with silvered wisdom. \
And lightning-barbs would have to \
thorn my baying heart before I \
take heed of the old saying: \
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;_beware the gáe bolga._

A new scene dries over my canvas sash: \
fleet-footed ranger fires a fletched arrow, \
studded with the twinkle of time, tearing \
scourge marks upon the celestial cloth. \
A brilliant black swallows Ouranos whole, \
bearing a new primordial embryo to begin \
its rebirth — booming an orchestral roar \
as virgin skies, spattered of cosmic color, \
take newborn inhabitance over the gods. 

A world schism breaks against way of life, \
wildfire ignited of the Horsemen’s trails \
spring forth polychromatic gardens, \
the heavens collapse cloud kingdom, \
and I can finally see: gilded visions \
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;flamingo horizons drape the cloud fabric. 

Lest we forget Death, \
&emsp;&emsp;he too fares mercy, \
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;so stay in the dark! 

Dear Reaper, 

Of all insistent foul pervading so, \
I beseech thee, heavy anchors thy blade, \
and I may yet hear thy winged-scythe howl, \
bring tyrannicide, purge my rotten life.
