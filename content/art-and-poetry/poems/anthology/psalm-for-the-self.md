My life wears a sarong sash of \
Van Gogh greens & mythic tapestries, \
of the Earth’s water-blood & soil-skin, \
dawned of the frost father, Ymir, \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his dismembered image. \
I struggle — \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to jot tempest movements in a moment, \
when my marionette muscles strain in age; \
but I would write still, on broken fingers, \
even if a humble life would allow me to tenant \
in Elysium and crown a hero-halo over my brow, \
I would torch my ghost in ghastly flames, \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stirred in my scorn to live now, even if \
in this life the Lord's trumpeters would not \
bless me with silver-gleamed wisdom. \
And lightning-barbs would have to \
thorn my baying heart before I \
take heed of the old saying: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_beware the gáe bolga._

Upon my canvas paint, dries a new scene: \
Fleet-footed ranger fires a fletched arrow, \
studded with the twinkle of time, tearing \
scourge marks upon the celestial cloth. \
A brilliant black swallows Ouranos whole, \
bearing a new primordial embryo to begin \
its rebirth — booming an orchestral roar \
as virgin skies, spattered of cosmic color, \
take newborn inhabitance over the gods. 

A world schism breaks against way of life, \
wildfire ignited of the Horsemen’s trails \
spring forth polychromatic gardens, \
the heavens collapse cloud kingdom, \
and I can finally see: gilded visions \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flamingo horizons drape the cloud fabric. 

Lest we forget Death, he too fares mercy \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so stay in the dark! \
Dear Reaper, of all insistent foul pervading so, \
I beseech thee, heavy anchors thy blade, \
and I may yet hear thy winged-scythe howl, \
bring tyrannicide, purge my rotten life.
