Unfortunately, I haven't written any new poems in some years now. In short, I have a complicated history wrestling against my own self-doubt as a poet and questioning my relationship with the medium altogether. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before it returns to my life as it always has and I'm hoping administering a website will give me an incentive to write more, but this is what I have for now. There are other poems I have finished and am fond of but I think they are _too_ soul-baring for the public eye.
