I would be remiss to not include some sort of homage written for what is arguably the most influential artform that has graced my life. Much of my idiolect and mannerisms are largely attributed to how I have been molded by the written word from the titans of prose and poetry before my time. 

And in an ironic turn of events, I actually don't even know what to write here. I have a lot I could say and I think the freedom is giving me some choice paralysis, but I promise to fill this section out with some quality or interesting discussion. Give me some time to recollect and treat this with the due dilligence I want it to have and I'm sure I'll have something ready soon enough (including potentially some of my own poetry to post?)
