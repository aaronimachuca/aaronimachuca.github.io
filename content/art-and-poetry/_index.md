I picked up poetry back when I was 16 as a form of self-expression and have been writing on and off since then. It's a special medium that has connected me with every other artform I am drawn towards (more on that [here](https://aaronmachuca.com/musings/on-art-and-poetry/)). Poetry to me is the most natural means by which one elevates their writing to contend with the ineffable. It is the unconventional literature form that countries around the globe have unanimously chosen to relay their legends and cultural values. And no matter what stage of my life I'm in, I always find myself homing back to the champions of poetry to seek meaning in their writing.

My poems conspicuously reflect works I draw inspiration from, which are often not of this century. They are terse, archaic, and hide behind narratives that drive vehicular metaphors for what I mean to say. Despite my reservations on contemporary poetry, I don't usually like rhyme schemes and have an awkward grip over the meter so much of my work is written in free verse. Bear with me as I slowly update this page with new(?) poems.

You can also find some visual artwork that I've created here too; though, I don't draw often, and when I do they're usually napkin or notebook doodles. When I feel compelled to put in more effort, I draw in classic MS Paint on my aged Huion tablet. I only recently started painting with color so I don't have much to show for now â€” though this may change in the future.
