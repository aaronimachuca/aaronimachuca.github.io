I picked up poetry back when I was 16 as a form of self-expression and have been writing on and off since then. It's a special medium that has connected me with every other artform I am drawn towards (more on that [here](https://aaronmachuca.com/musings/on-art-and-poetry/)). Unfortunately, I haven't written any new poems in some years now but I'm hoping that administering a website will give me an incentive to write more.

You can also find some visual artwork that I've created here too; though, I don't draw often, and when I do they're usually napkin or lecture note doodles. When I feel compelled to put in more effort, I draw in classic MS Paint on my aged Huion tablet. I only recently started painting with color so I don't have much to show for now--though this may change in the future.
