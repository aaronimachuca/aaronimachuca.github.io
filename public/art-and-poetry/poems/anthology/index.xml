      <description>My life wears a sarong sash of Van Gogh greens &amp;amp; mythic tapestries, of the Earth’s water-blood &amp;amp; soil-skin, dawned of the frost father, Ymir, in his dismembered image. I struggle — to jot tempest movements in a moment, when my marionette muscles strain in age; but I would write still, on broken fingers, even if a humble life would allow me to tenant in Elysium and crown a hero-halo over my brow, I would torch my ghost in ghastly flames, stirred in my scorn to live now, even if in this life the Lord&amp;rsquo;s trumpeters would not bless me with silver-gleamed wisdom.</description>
